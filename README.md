# Syntax

There are a few syntax and rules for a dairy file.

## Rules
Use a H1 Heading to start a topic. All paragrah should be inside a topic.
```markdown
# Topic1
<Here is the content>
```

Use an empty link to create a tag. Different type of starter indicate various tag
1. `&` for location: `[&Home]()`
2. `@` for a contact: `[@Wife]()`
3. `#` for a general tagï¼š`[#Icee cream]()`

Use regular todo to create a todo list.
```markdown
- [ ] write some code
- [ ] do some exercise
- [ ] enjoy my snacks
```
Use an unordered list to indicate spending
```markdown
- $<amount>: item name
```
